# This file provides the shared logic for building, testing, linting,

# all language types. Individual projects can include language-specific
# mk files (rust.mk, golang.mk, python.mk) and selectively enable
# Docker or Kubernetes support.

# All build artifacts and intermediates go under .build to keep the workspace clean.
# The language-specific mk file should place compiler artifacts, caches, etc. under .build/.
BUILD_DIR := .build

# If you want to differentiate local vs CI environment, define:
#  - CI=1 for the CI pipeline
#  - Otherwise local usage is assumed
# For example, cover might produce a CodeCov-friendly file in CI mode, and a textual

# Meta targets
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The "default" target is typically "build" but might also include
# "image" and/or "k8s" if those features are enabled in a project.
# The "verify" target ensures that test, lint, and coverage all run.
# Projects can override or extend these if needed.

## Weâ€™ll gather targets that should be part of "default" dynamically.
DEFAULT_TARGETS := build

## If a project wants the "image" target, it can set `DOCKER_ENABLED = 1`.
## If set, we append image to the DEFAULT_TARGETS.
ifneq ($(strip $(DOCKER_ENABLED)),)
DEFAULT_TARGETS += image
endif

## If a project wants the "k8s" or "run" targets, it can set `K8S_ENABLED = 1`.
## If set, we append k8s (and possibly run) to the DEFAULT_TARGETS.
ifneq ($(strip $(K8S_ENABLED)),)
DEFAULT_TARGETS += k8s
# In many projects, "run" is not necessarily always triggered by default,
# so you can decide whether to add it here or keep it separate.
endif
