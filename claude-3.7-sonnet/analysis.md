# Analysis

Overall approach: uses language-specific targets and overrides for the base targets; it actually analyzed all of the
fifteen requirements I gave it to see if it met them.

## Evaluation criteria

1.  Score - 0.9: the way that it adds/sets the default target is not awesome, but it works and is probably easily
    fixable.
2.  Score - 1: It read and understood the docker command that I gave in the examples
3.  Score - 1: It read and understood the k8s generation commands that I gave in the examples
4.  Score - 1: Each target has an explicit pre, post, and run step, which can be overridden or use the defaults.
5.  Score - 0.5: the docker and k8s files (and the rust file) uses the ARTIFACTS variable, but this isn't replicated in
    the golang/python/generic build files
6.  Score - 0.75: Each language has language-specific build-in-docker targets, I think they don't quite all link up
    correctly, though; could also be DRY'ed up more.
7.  Score - 1: it does implement the standard targets in each of the requested languages
8.  Score - 0.75: it copies my release target for each of the different languages, could be DRY'ed more
9.  Score - 1
10. Score - 0.75: I believe it gets Golang cross-compilation right, I think the Rust cross-compilation is close
11. Score - 1
12. Score - 1: I think this is correct since it more-or-less copied what I did
13. Score - 1: It looks like it did this correctly for go and rust (it made an assumption about `~/go/pkg`, but
    whatever); for Python this requirement makes less sense, because you can't really share virtualenvs.
14. Score - 1: it accomplished this with variables instead of inclusion, which isn't my preferred solution but it works
15. Score - 1: it did allow for differences in CI versus local behaviour

## Unspoken/hidden evaluation criteria:

1.  Pre-commit usage: score 0.5, it did recognize that I'm using pre-commit, but it only included that for Rust, and it
    also added in a cargo clippy check.  For Go and Rust it didn't default to pre-commit at all
2.  grcov usage: score 0.5 Rust coverage looks right, but testing coverage locally needs more work than what it did; it
    appears to have hallucinated an argument to `go tool cover`; it did do Python coverage right.
3.  Documentation and comments: score 0.75, it gave a nice README, but I preferred the output from chatgpt-o1 here.
4.  DRY-ing: score 0, this feels like it took my existing code and made it even more spaghetti, instead of cleaning it
    up
5.  Vibes score: 0.25, this hit most of my criteria really well, and it did a great job of incorporating the
    pre-existing context from my provided examples.  But I'm worried that this hits the "uncanny valley", I think there
    are a bunch of subtle bugs in here that would still take some time to debug, and I wish that it had done a bit
    _more_ refactoring/DRYing up my existing code.

**TOTAL SCORE**: 15.6/20
